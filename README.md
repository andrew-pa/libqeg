cross platform graphics API (and game engine?)

Right now it supports OpenGL and DirectX on Windows 8.1, GL is mostly to prove that is is really "cross platform".
However, don't expect that you won't have to rewrite your code when you want to port to a new platform, you will find some platform dependancy.
