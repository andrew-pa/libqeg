Load Resources in a uniform way
	- shaders
	- models
	- textures
Advanced Texture types and Texture C++ class hierarchy
	- Texture Arrays in shaders (as in Texture2D bleg[5])
	- Texture Arrays in C++ (as in Texture2DArray...)
	- 3D Textures
	- Texture Cubes
	- Depth Render Textures
	- Render Texture Cubes
	- Render to multi textures
	- Procedural textures
Resource packages?
Gamepad input (xinput)
Improved cameras
AUX stuff
	- shaders (phong, ...)
	- GI?



















- improve shader situation
- Good Mouse Camera control
- Geometry and Tessellation shaders?
- Shaders (phong, ...)
- Textures w/ SOIL on all platforms


- Create a device wide buffer pool, so that you can allocate a whole bunch of buffers at the same time, at least for GL
